# CUDA
Here are excerise about CUDA which I had did before. 

# CUDA requirement
At first, you need to have a nvidia GPU card for your computer. Second, your GPU card should able to support any one of the CUDA version.

Then, you can go to this
[Link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=Ubuntu&target_version=1810) to download essential CUDA package and toolkit.

Or you can choose to learnt [OPENCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl)

# Basic
The most import of CUDA is understanding the relationship and how to use grid, block and thread.

# CNN
CNN is the short term of [Convolutional Neural Network]()

# Julia
[Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) a special math question. It is a good title for you to train some special programming language.

# Matrix
Simple math problem matrix transpose, matrix multiplication and matrix addition. It is more fundamental requirement for learning cuda because matrix could be useful when you are doing CUDA project.

# Blur
[Gaussian Blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) seems difficult but actually it is very simple image processing skills. Moreover, you may need to do gaussian blur first before any other image processing functions for better performance. Thus, using CUDA may help you reduce the image processing time.
